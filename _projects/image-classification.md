This is a exploratory group project in MATH253 Statistical Machine Learning class. We used Kaggle Intel Image Classification dataset which contains 17,034 pictures of 6 categories. We compared four supervised machine learning models to classify images: decision tree, tree pruning, random forest, and convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that while the decision tree classification produces a decent result than guessing by taking the majority votes, the CNN method provides a much better accuracy at around 80%.
