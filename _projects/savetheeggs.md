[Save the Eggs](https://github.com/RohitBagda/SaveEggsGame) is a 2-D HTML game which prompts players to catch as many eggs as possible on a screen. I developed the routing, states and game logic in JavaScript, Phaser, HTML, and CSS. Please see our [Github Repo](https://github.com/RohitBagda/SaveEggsGame) for details. You can also download it on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.macalester.savetheeggs)
