This is a geospatial data visualization project in Interactive Computer Graphics class. This interactive system visualizes earthquakes happened between 1905 and 2007 using data from NASA on a 3D globe. We apply textures to 3D objects, algorithmically created a 3D mesh and display it using VBOs and VAOs.
