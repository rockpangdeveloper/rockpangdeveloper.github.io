This is a group project in my capstone course Human-Computer Interaction. We are designing a web-based interface to help students focus on extensive readings, especially for people with ADHD, using React, Firebase, and JavaScript. We have conducted multiple contextual inquiries and usability tests. We are developing our digital product in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The product is on its way.
