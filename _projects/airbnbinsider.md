[Airbnb Insider](https://airbnb-insider-81935.firebaseapp.com/) is a data visualization website comparing 8,695 Airbnb prices and 104 neighborhood housing prices in Seattle. I used React, JSX, and Firebase for this project. Please visit the [Github Repo](https://github.com/ykelly/insider) for details.
