Hello, this is Rock! I am a senior student at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shilad Sen](http://www.shilad.com/) and [Prof. Andrew Beveridge](https://www.macalester.edu/~abeverid/). I am interested in human-computer interaction, human-centered computing, Info/data visualization, and social computing. I major in Computer Science, Applied Math & Statistics, and minor in Political Science. My GPA is 3.94.

I am currently a research assistant of Prof. Sen on [Cartograph](http://cartograph.info/) project. We are creating semantic maps that visualize English wikipedia in the form of real-world style geographical maps. I am also developing a web-based app called *Pinhole Reader* to help people focus on extensive readings, especially for people with ADHD.

I am also on Macalester Track & Field team. In my spare time, I play basketball, soccer, and table tennis. I also explore side projects with friends.
