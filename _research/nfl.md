This is a course project in Computational Linear Algebra class. Sports ranking is a science. How to assign a standardized strength score to dozens of teams, where any number of games can happen between any pairs of teams? Whois the strongest in the intricate network of ”A beats B, B beats C and C beats A”?How do we interpret the strength scores? Sports ranking is also an art. Is winning the game the only thing that matters? Or do the scores earned in the games also matter? In this [technical report](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w3gl9h9epxe1du2/Ranking%20NFL%20Teams.pdf?dl=0), we explore 3 eigenvector ranking methods and 1 least squares ranking method, explain their theories and compare their pros and cons.
