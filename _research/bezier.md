This is a course project in Computational Linear Algebra class. Bezier curves are parametric curves frequently applied in computer graphics. In this report, we will use cubic Bezier curves to design letter fonts. We will first explain how Bezier curves work, or specifically, how the two control points and two end points define a smooth curve.Then, we will demonstrate how to use Bezier codes in R with some examples of our letter designs, and finally, in section 4, we will include some helpful hints and close-up images of our designs.
