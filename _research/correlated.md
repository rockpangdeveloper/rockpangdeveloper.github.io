This is a group research project in my Statistics Capstone course titled Correlated Data advised by [Prof. Brianna Heggeseth](https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth). We unraveled the mathematics behind the Vector Autoregressive model in multivariate time series analysis. We used an example of four global stock markets to provide a detailed introduction of VAR model to intro to statistics students. We also discuss the Impulse Response Function and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition, which capture the modelâ€™s dynamic behaviors. We illustrate the VAR model in a real-world example of comparing stock market in mainland China, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The tutorial contains many useful R codes and graph interpretation. We provide concluding remarks on the advantages and disadvantages of VAR models in general. Then, we discuss how to make more complex models such as Structural VAR model and Bayesian VAR model.
