[This](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mgswee7jyomb5w3/A%20Brief%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Vector%20Autoregressive%20Model%20and%20its%20Applications.pdf?dl=0) is a group Capstone Project on the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. VAR model is one of the most flexible models for the analysis of multivariate time series. We unraveled the mathematics behind it and used an example of four global stock markets to help into to statistics student learn about this useful model.

This tutorial aims to provide detailed introduction of VAR model. In Section 2, we introduce the model. We also discuss the Impulse Response Function and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition, which capture the modelâ€™s dynamic behaviors. In Section 3, we illustrate the VAR model in a real-world example of comparing stock market in mainland China, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This section contains many useful R codes and graph interpretation. We provide concluding remarks on the advantages and disadvantages of VAR models in general. Then, we discuss how to make more complex models such as Structural VAR model and Bayesian VAR model.
