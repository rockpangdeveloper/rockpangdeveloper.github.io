Katz Centrality is one of many metrics for determining important nodes in a network. Katz centrality assigns relative importance to a networkâ€™s nodes by examining all possible paths between every pair of nodes. [In this paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aqgeajgpi1c879a/Katz%20Status%20Index.pdf?dl=0), we implement Katz centrality using the Jacobi method, and show how it works on two examples, a work flow network and the Wikipedia network.
