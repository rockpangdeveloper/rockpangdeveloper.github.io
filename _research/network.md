This is a group research project in Network Science Capstone class advised by [Prof. Andrew Beveridge](https://www.macalester.edu/~abeverid/). It is a social network visualization and analysis on global arms trade using arms trade data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database from 2016 - 2018. I constructed the social network and detect hidden community within this network using the state-of-the-art Louvain algorithm. Later, I used hierarchical clustering to consider the node attributes of each country, such as their domestic arms production, freedom score and membership of international peace treaties. We also incorporate countries location to see if, for example, European countries are "European" in terms of arms trade. In the end, I combined the topological structure and node attributes to generate a more comprehensive community detection algorithms. We found that powerful countries tend to ally themselves with each others and leave countries with less military capacity in another community.
